# QueritelPractical

This practical is supposed to display the use of the javascript api key for google maps.

The map is first called onto the index html using an external link triggering an api request to google maps platform
the settings set up the center of the map and other conditions wanted.

A "Locations" and "Users" button  was made to be linked to the two functions.

API alls were made to the base api link to queritel to show the places stored that are linked to particular users.
